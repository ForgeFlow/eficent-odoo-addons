=============================
Procurement Location Analytic
=============================

For sales, the source location should contain the same analytic account
than the order. If it's a dropship two movements have to be done at the
same time. This module checks the route for a sales order.


Usage
=====

Select the analytic account in the SO. The picking type must be one with a
good source location
