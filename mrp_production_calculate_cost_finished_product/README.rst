MRP Production Calculate Cost Finished Product
==============================================

This module calculates the cost of the finished product and adds this cost
to the finished product stock move & associated quant.

The current module will only consider as cost of the finished product the
cost of the raw materials that were used to produce it. Other modules
can extend it to add other costs, such as labor, machine, subcontracting,
etc...
